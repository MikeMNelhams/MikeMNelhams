### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with experience in Python, Java, C# and MATLAB. 
I enjoy working on C#/Unity GameDev in my spare time.

Some of my Python past projects: 

- [OFCOM Unsupervised Learning with Sky Broadband](https://github.com/MikeMNelhams/SkyBroadbandProject)
- [Lil A.I. Generative LSTM With custom Loss functions](https://github.com/MikeMNelhams/Lil-A.I.-Approaches-to-Rap-Lyric-Generation)
- [Sperm Tracking and fertility prediction with MOJO.AI](https://github.com/MikeMNelhams/SpermTracking)
- [User recommendation system for Dating Application](https://github.com/MikeMNelhams/Recommender-System-for-User-User-Ratings)

My current C# / Unity Dev project:

- I will publish details with Update 1.1.0 ;)

Current Python projects:

There is a new 2v2v2v2 LoL game mode and I've created a tool to scrape data and measure useful statistics. 
As far as I can see, there is no proper website that records pairwise data, so voila:
- [Lol Arena Data Scraper](https://github.com/MikeMNelhams/LoL_ArenaDataScraper)
